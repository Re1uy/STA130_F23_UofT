    "<!-- `df['single column']` or df[['one column', 'another column']] or `df[boolean_selection_column]` <--(!); `df.iloc[]` only takes numbers to index rows/columns; and the most powerful of these is the last, which is typically used something like `df.loc[boolean_selection_column, ['one column', 'another column']]`-->\n",
    "3. For a column `col` in the `df`<br>what's the difference between `df.col`, `df['col']`, and `df[['col']]`?  <!-- no difference between the first two: they give a column (of type `pd.Series`); but, the last gives a pandas data frame with a single column... Yes, these two things are different... -->\n",

    "5. What is \"boolean selection\"? <!-- `df[boolean_selection_column]` and `df.loc[boolean_selection_column, ['one column', 'another column']]` are examples... but what do they do?
